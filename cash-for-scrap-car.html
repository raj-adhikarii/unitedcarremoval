                            <p><strong>Car Wreckers near me</strong> buy scrap cars for auto parts and take those scrap cars to the wrecking ward. Then the wreckers dismantle car parts and separate reusable and recyclable parts. Then after recycling those used parts, they are further sold to others. Car wreckers pay instant cash up to $10000 for scrap cars.</p>
