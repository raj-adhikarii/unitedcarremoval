                            <p>Our team has comprehensive experience in valuation and inspection. They have formulated a database of values for a wide range of vehicles. From there, we cross-reference the details you provide and calculate an approximate value for your vehicle. Mileage, condition, miscellaneous additions, and such all factor into our decision. We assess the vehicle first-hand. And this process usually increases the value of the vehicle.</p>
