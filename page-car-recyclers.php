                        <p class="mb-2">At United Car Removal, you get much more than the convenience of your fluids, liquids, and fuel drained from your scrap, accident, old, or damaged vehicle. You also get the satisfaction of keeping the environment green. Unlike other <strong>car recyclers</strong> in Australia, which contaminate the environment with pollutants and contaminants, we contain and recycle your car, right down to the oil in the car so that hazards don’t creep into the environment.</p>

                        <p class="mb-2">We have a team of green <strong>car recyclers</strong> that have years of experience in car wrecking. Our wreckers dismantle your vehicle to refurbish and recycle parts under the hood, tires for new products like turf, and new tire manufacturers and recycle the scrap steel of the vehicle for new steel. When you finish recycling your auto, you will get good cash in your hands. What’s more, is that you get that cash before we <a href="#">recycle the vehicle</a>. Up to $9999 CASH. Just give us a call and we’ll make you an offer on your scrapped vehicle to recycle today.</p>
